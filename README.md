# Task list with Vanilla JS 📝

This small project consists of a **task list** created with **HTML, Javascript** and the CSS framework **Materialize.**

The UI contains an input to write and save tasks, which are not only displayed in a list, but also are kept in the **local storage,** so they remain after the browser is refreshed.

A **filter-task** function and a **clear-tasks** button are included as well.
